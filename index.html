  <strong>A</strong> racing game for mobile, produced by Japanese game company Infinity Vector Ltd and released on June 26, 2016.
<br> Released on iOS and Android OS. All of them can be enjoyed for free and are in-app purchases. In mobile racing games,
<br> oversteer and understeer are well implemented to the extent that it is difficult to keep up with this physics engine.
<br> Optimization and graphics are also top-notch. However, after the recent update, frame drops were severe due to the improvement of graphic quality
<br> and the performance of vehicles was downgraded. You can experience various races such as on-road, rally, and drift.

<br> The operation method is divided into tilt, steering, buttons and controller. In the case of tilt and steering,
<br> it is clear that it is sensitive or accurate, that is, it feels far from reality, but it is understandable given that
<br> it is a mobile game. Since the buttons are literally button-type operation, it is very far from reality.
<br> There are three driving assistance functions. TCS, ABS and Steering Assist are unique features.
<br> First, since TCS is a function that controls the wheel spin of the vehicle, it is not necessary for front-wheel and four-wheel drive vehicles.
<br> When used in a rear wheel vehicle, it has the advantage of reducing wheel spin depending on the setting sensitivity,
<br> but it is better not to use TCS at all because the overall acceleration force of the vehicle is nerfed.
<br> It's okay to apply it a little when you get used to it at the beginning after purchasing the vehicle,
<br> ABS is a function that prevents brake lock. If you use the brake slider and are used to it, it is better to turn off the ABS,
<br> as it shows a significantly stronger brake performance than when the ABS is turned on. Therefore, it has the advantage of reducing lap time,
<br> but it requires a lot of practice because it requires very precise control.
<br> Steering Assist is a function that allows the vehicle to automatically maneuver the steering wheel to a corner without having to operate the steering wheel.
<br> There is no difference in the performance of the vehicle by turning it on and off,
<br> but using this function gives a feeling that is very far from reality.
